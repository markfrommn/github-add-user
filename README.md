# github-add-user
Script to auto-add a github user.

This is adapted from miraculixx/github-add-user.  Real credit goes to github.com/miraculixx - my additions here are minor.

Enhancements are:

* Support for taking API token from a file (avoid credentials on command line).
* Support for specifying an Org.
* Support for specifying a GHE endpoint.
